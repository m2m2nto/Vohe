# Vohe — Domain Glossary

Vohe is a personal iOS flashcard app for daily vocabulary practice. This glossary fixes the language used across code, specs, plans, PRs, and conversations. It is **not** a spec — it defines terms, not behavior.

## Language

### Entities

**Deck**:
A named collection of Cards sharing one language pair (e.g. "Croatian–Italian"). A **projection of one Dictionary** — at most one Deck per language pair, auto-populated with one Card per Dictionary entry. There is no file-import path; the maintainer is the sole source of new pairs.
_Avoid_: "list", "set", "collection".

**Card**:
A `(front, back)` text pair belonging to exactly one Deck. Mirrors a DictionaryEntry of its Deck's pair and adds scheduling state (`Box`, `nextDue`) and a `wrongLastSession` flag (see Wrong-last-session). The projection never deletes a Card.
_Avoid_: "entry", "word", "pair", "flashcard" (use Card; "entry" is the Dictionary-side term).

### Dictionary

**Dictionary**:
The canonical vocabulary content for one language pair — a list of `(front, back)` entries, bundled with the app and refreshed at runtime via the manifest pull (ADR-0003). Exactly one Dictionary per pair; the maintainer is its sole source. A Deck projects one Dictionary.
_Avoid_: "reference", "word list" (the Dictionary is the source of truth, not a side reference).

**DictionaryEntry**:
One `(front, back)` row of a Dictionary, tagged with an **Origin**. Has no Leitner state — that lives on its projected Card.
_Avoid_: "Card".

**Origin**:
The provenance tag on a DictionaryEntry: `canonical` (from the bundled/synced file), `userAddition` (the user added it), or `canonicalWithEdit` (a canonical entry the user rewrote). Drives the "mine" marker — blue dot for `userAddition`, blue pencil for `canonicalWithEdit` — shown in `DictionaryView` and on the projected `CardsListView` row.
_Avoid_: "source", "kind".

**Projection**:
The relationship by which a Deck mirrors its Dictionary: every entry of the pair becomes a Card (Box 0 when new), edits propagate to the matching Card preserving Leitner state, and Cards are never deleted. Performed by `DeckDictionaryProjector`.
_Avoid_: "sync" (reserved for the remote manifest pull), "import".

**Suggestion**:
A user's local change to a pair's Dictionary, accumulated per pair as **additions** (net-new entries) and **edits** (a canonical entry rewritten). Applied locally on read (user change wins), shipped to the maintainer in batch via the share sheet, and pruned by Post-sync cleanup once canonical adopts it.
_Avoid_: "contribution" (use Suggestion for the unit; "contribute" is fine as the verb).

**Pending suggestions**:
The not-yet-adopted Suggestions for a pair (`additions + edits`). Surfaced by the per-pair "Send pending (n)" button and its red-dot badge in `DictionaryView`.

**Post-sync cleanup**:
The pass that runs after a successful canonical pull and prunes Suggestions the maintainer adopted (an addition now in canonical; an edit whose `edited` value is now in canonical). Removing a Suggestion clears the "mine" marker on its entry.
_Avoid_: "Backfill" (that is the one-shot Leitner state-population op).

### Session

**Session**:
One activity of swiping through an ordered list of Cards from start to end. Every Session has a Mode, a Slot, a Direction, and an Outcome. Resuming a `PausedSession` continues the **same** Session — the once-per-Card scheduling guard and Reinforcement counters persist across the pause.
_Avoid_: "run", "drill", "round".

**Mode**:
The Session's pool: `perDeck(Deck)` draws from a single Deck; `global([Card])` draws from a pre-built cross-deck list (currently used only by Review).
_Avoid_: "scope", "kind".

**Direction**:
**Forward** = front shows `language1`. **Inverted** = front shows `language2`. Stored as `inverted: Bool`. Global Sessions are always Forward.

**Slot**:
The session-length cap. Values: `5`, `20`, `50`, `100`, or `All` (sentinel `0`). Stored as `wordCount: Int`. Reinforcement re-queues can push the final `order.count` above Slot.
_Avoid_: "word count", "session size".

**Outcome**:
What persists at end-of-Session. A perDeck Session ends as `SessionResult` (completed), `PausedSession` (paused), or nothing (discarded). A global Session is **ephemeral**: it produces no `SessionResult` and cannot be paused — only completed (no record) or discarded.
_Avoid_: "result" (overloaded — `SessionResult` is one specific Outcome).

**Review**:
The Library-level entry point that opens a global Session over all currently-Due Cards across all Decks. Always Forward, ephemeral. Row label hides the count when N > 100.
_Avoid_: "global review", "review session" (the row is "Review"; the Session it opens is a global Session).

**Practice Hardest**:
A kind of perDeck Session with `onlyHardest = true`. Orders cards by `DifficultyStore` wrong-rate descending; ignores Box state and Due dates. Cards must have `seen ≥ 3` to be eligible.
_Avoid_: "hardest mode", "hard practice".

**Quick session**:
A perDeck Session with Slot 5, started by tapping a reminder notification, run on the most-recently-Practiced Deck.
_Avoid_: "notification session", "5-card session".

**Practice**:
The act of completing a perDeck Session (writing a `SessionResult`). Review Sessions deliberately **do not count** as Practice — they are ephemeral by design. `lastPracticedDeck` and `lastPracticedAt` both consider only `SessionResult` rows.
_Avoid_: using "practice" to describe Review or partial sessions in code/spec prose.

### Scheduling

**Box**:
A Card's place in the Leitner ladder. Index 0–5. Box 0 = New (never graded). Boxes 1–5 = Scheduled, with intervals 1, 3, 7, 21, 60 days respectively.
_Avoid_: "level", "stage", "bucket".

**New**:
A Card in Box 0, never graded. `nextDue = .distantPast`. Eligible the moment it's imported. New cards are **not** Due — Due means Scheduled-and-eligible. Either Grade (Again or Good) promotes a New card to Box 1 on its first grading.
_Avoid_: "unseen", "never-reviewed", "fresh".

**Scheduled**:
A Card in Box 1–5. Has a meaningful `nextDue`.
_Avoid_: "in rotation", "active", "tracked".

**Due**:
A Scheduled Card whose `nextDue` is strictly before the start of the next calendar day (today or earlier). New Cards are explicitly **not** Due — they are New. A perDeck Session order partitions Cards into three disjoint sets: **Due**, **New**, **Undue**.
_Avoid_: "eligible", "ready".

**Overdue**:
A Due Card with `nextDue < startOfDay(today)` — strictly before today's start. Every Due Card is either Overdue or due-today.

**Overdueness**:
The magnitude `startOfDay(today) - nextDue` (days). Descending sort key within the Due bucket.

**Undue**:
A Scheduled Card with `nextDue >= tomorrowStart`. Used as filler at the end of a perDeck Session order when Due + New don't fill the Slot.

**Grade**:
The binary outcome of one swipe. Two values: **Good** (right swipe — knew it) and **Again** (left swipe — didn't know it). Matches `LeitnerScheduler.Grade`. UI badges may read "CORRECT" / "WRONG"; code prose, specs, and PRs use Grade vocabulary.
_Avoid_: "wrong", "correct", "right", "left", "wasCorrect", "answer", "score".

**Reinforcement**:
The in-Session re-queue behavior: when a Card is graded Again, it's appended back into `order` so the user sees it again before the Session ends. Capped at 2 extra appearances per Card per Session (`reinforcementCap`). Internal term — never user-facing.
_Avoid_: "re-queue" (use Reinforcement in prose; "re-queue" is fine when describing the mechanic).

**Backfill**:
The one-shot operation (`SchedulerMigration.run`) that, on first launch after upgrading to Leitner, assigns initial `boxIndex` and `nextDue` to every existing Card based on its `DifficultyStore` wrong-rate. Distinct from SwiftData schema migration: schema migration adds the *fields*; Backfill populates them.
_Avoid_: "migration" alone (ambiguous with schema migration).

### Stats & ranking

**Stats**:
The per-Card historical counters (`seen`, `wrong`) held by `DifficultyStore` and persisted to `difficulty.json`. Keyed by `(deckName, front, back)` — independent of the Card's SwiftData UUID. Survives Card edit and Deck rename via `DifficultyStore.rename` / `renameDeck`.
_Avoid_: "history", "metrics".

**Wrong-rate**:
`wrong / seen`. Defined only when `seen ≥ 3` (`DifficultyStore.minSeenForRanking`). Sort key for Practice Hardest. Backfill bucket boundaries: `<0.2 → Box 3`, `<0.4 → Box 2`, else `Box 1`.
_Avoid_: "difficulty score" (use Wrong-rate; "difficulty score" is the same value but the noun isn't useful elsewhere).

**Rankable**:
A Card eligible for Practice Hardest — i.e. has `seen ≥ 3`.

**Wrong-last-session**:
A per-Card sticky flag (`Card.wrongLastSession`) that is set to `true` on every Again Grade and `false` on every Good Grade. Cards never touched in any Session retain the default `false`. Surfaced by `DeckDetailView`'s "Wrong last session" row and the `WrongCardsView` list. Independent of Box state — a Card can be in Box 5 *and* have `wrongLastSession == true` if its most recent Grade was Again. The name is slightly misleading: the value reflects "the most recent Grade was Again," not "Again in the last completed Session."
_Avoid_: treating this as a session-scoped flag — it is per-Card.

### Reminders & notifications

**Reminder**:
A scheduled local notification that asks the user to start a short Session. Reminders are produced by `ReminderScheduler` from a single user-configured **Reminder settings** record.
_Avoid_: using "notification" for the user-facing concept; "Reminder" is the user-facing word (bell icon, "Daily reminders" toggle, Reminder settings sheet).

**Reminder settings**:
The user's single configuration record (`ReminderSettings`), persisted to `UserDefaults`. Specifies `enabled`, `mode` (Random or Exact), `count`, and either a window (for Random) or specific times (for Exact).

**Notification**:
The iOS-level delivery mechanism (`UNUserNotification`). Use this word only when discussing iOS plumbing — authorization, delegate callbacks, pending requests. The user-facing concept is a Reminder.

### Library surfaces

**Library**:
The home screen (`LibraryView`) — list of Decks plus the Review row and the In Progress section. The `+` toolbar button opens a **Dictionary picker** over locally-known canonical pairs (it no longer imports files): picking a pair opens its Deck, creating and projecting one first if none exists.

**In Progress**:
The Library section listing `PausedSession`s. Capped at 5 (`pausedCap`); when the cap is hit, new perDeck Sessions cannot be paused (they can still complete or be discarded).

**Active session**:
The currently-presented Session sheet, one of: Quick session (`.quickDeck`), Resumed Paused Session (`.resume`), or Review (`.globalReview`). Per-deck "Start Session" is launched from `DeckDetailView`, not Library.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** I imported the new Spanish deck yesterday and graded 20 cards. This morning Library says "Review (3 due)." Why only 3?
>
> **Designer:** Because those 20 you graded yesterday are now Scheduled, in Box 1, with `nextDue = tomorrow`. They're Undue today. The 3 Due Cards must be from an older Deck whose Scheduled Cards crossed their `nextDue` overnight. Your Spanish deck still has lots of New Cards too — those are eligible but won't show in the Review count, because Review only counts Due.
>
> **Dev:** Got it. If I tap Review and finish all 3 Cards, will it count as my Practice for today?
>
> **Designer:** No. Review is ephemeral — no `SessionResult` is written, so `lastPracticedAt` doesn't move. To count as Practice today, start a perDeck Session from one of the Decks and complete it. The Quick session from your next reminder tap will still open on whichever Deck you Practiced most recently.
>
> **Dev:** And if I swipe Again on the first card three times in a row?
>
> **Designer:** Reinforcement caps at 2 extras. First Again — Card requeues at the end, Box becomes 1, `nextDue` = tomorrow. Second Again on the same Card — requeues again. Third Again — Box stays 1, `nextDue` stays tomorrow, but no third requeue. Subsequent grades on that Card record Stats but don't touch Box or `nextDue` — Reinforcement is a learning step, not a scheduling event.
